All the [example databases](../README.md#example-datasets) in this folder are sourced from [BirdBench](https://bird-bench.github.io/).

To use your own database, please follow the instructions provided [here](../README.md#use-your-own-database).

For reference, the ***.json*** files represent the output of the structure extraction module, which processes as input the database file or connection (e.g., .sqlite).

The ***.txt*** files represent the optional [Business Rules](../README.md#business-rules-semantic-layer) that can be defined for each database.
